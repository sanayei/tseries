    "You are a data scientist working as part of a data science team for the hotel. You have been tasked with generating a probability distribution of weekly cancellations for the hotel. This is necessary so that the hotel can allocate rooms more efficiently. Use the h1weekly.csv dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The manager has told you that the minimum number of cancellations recorded in a week was 14, while the maximum number of cancellations recorded in a week was 222.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using only this information, you have been instructed to make an assumption about the mean and standard deviation of the distribution, i.e. the manager is not allowing you to look at the dataset and compute these directly, as he/she believes that the sample size is not large enough to infer the true mean and standard deviation from the data available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assumptions regarding the mean and standard deviation are known as your prior assumptions, and you are assuming that weekly hotel cancellations follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, you are required to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use PyMC3 to generate a predictive posterior distribution, i.e. a distribution that reflects an updated estimate of the mean and standard deviation given the data in question. (Hint: Make sure your standard deviation is sizable enough to account for the fact that your prior mean estimate may have been significantly different from the true estimate).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Report the mean and standard deviation as generated by the posterior distribution."
